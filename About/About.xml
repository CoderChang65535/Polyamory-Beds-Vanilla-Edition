	<description>More beds for your polyamorous pawns!

This mod is a spiritual successor of Polygamy Beds by Joseph with code being completely rewritten. 

Features:
     - Triple, quadra sleeping spots and bedrolls (avaliable from the start);
     - Triple, quadra beds and royal beds (require 'Complex Furniture' to be researched, royal beds also require 8 skill in Construction);
     - Penta royal bed (requires 'Complex Furniture' to be researched, 8 skill in Construction).
Stats are carefully balanced to be in line with Vanilla beds, graphics is updated.

Includes full built-in support for [JPT] Soft Warm Beds!
 
Known issues
     - Some other mods may interfere with game's miniaturisation mechanics thus making it possible to install/uninstall sleeping spots (and you may get also get messages about 'Outdoor penalty' when placing sleeping spots outside).
Solution: move this mod higher up in the loading order.
     - When three or more pawns share the same bed, the bedroom looses personal tags. That is a problem for jealous pawns and pawns with royal titles as they specifically require personal bedrooms to be satisfied.
Solution: fight the Empire! Or consider that honour forbids pawns with titles to share bed with more than one person at a time.
 
Please report any problems and/or inconsequences!
